# PHBlog

In order to learn a little bit about PHP I created this project. It will be a small blogging system. It is just for learning so it probably won't become a real competitor to wordpress. ;)

## What wasn't done yet
Besides that this is a very simplistic prototype there are some things that were ignored on purpose.
* It's UI. By now its a technical prototype and you see that. I didn't bothered with CSS, I concentrated on PHP and the functionality.
* It's architecture isn't perfect but this are my first steps in my new PHP shoes so I think that's ok.
* Everything works with GET instead of POST, so you see all parameter in the URL. This isn't that bad since it is easier to debug, however you even see the password in plaintext. This should be the first thing to be changed if this should ever become something more than just a prototype.
* I'm sure there are some other things to improve. If you find something it would be awesome to let me know (just open an issue).
