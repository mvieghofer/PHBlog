# PHBlog

In order to learn a little bit about PHP I created this project. It will be a small blogging system. It is just for learning so it probably won't become a real competitor to wordpress. ;)

## What was done by now.
* I coded my first PHP project that actually does something. I have a Java background and is probably reflected by my coding style. I didn't read a lot about PHP before starting this project I just started coding and learnt by doing.
* SQL Injection and XSS are prevented.
* The password is stored encrypted in the database.

## What to do next
Besides that this is a very simplistic prototype there are some things that were ignored on purpose.
* It's UI. By now its a technical prototype and you see that. I didn't bothered with CSS, I concentrated on PHP and the functionality.
* I'm sure there are some other things to improve. If you find something it would be awesome to let me know (just open an issue).
